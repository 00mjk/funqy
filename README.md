## FunQy: A High-Level Quantum Programming Language

_Created by Albert Dayn & Ryan Vandersmith; course project for CSCI 4830 (Principles of Functional Programming) at University of Colorado Boulder_

FunQy is a concept for a terse, ergonomic quantum functional programming language. Our design intends to reduce the barrier to entry for aspiring quantum developers by using high-level abstractions and design patterns common to classical programming languages. 

The language itself will be implemented in Elm, but we may decide to include a supporting library written in Python for visualization and other auxillary features. 

This project is currently in its very early stages; we will update this readme to reflect our progress over the course of the project.
