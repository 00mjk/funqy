// Demonstration of the contradiction described in https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-05739-8

// Coin probability
let coin = F ^ T

// Coin flip result
let r: Bool = measure(coin)

// Hidden state constructed in `box1`
let box1 = if r then F ^ T else F 

// Measured state of `box1` after measurement
let box1_m: Bool = measure(box1)

// Probability space of `box2` depending on `coin` and `box1_m`
// This step encodes the "knowledge of quantum mechanics"
let box2 = if coin then box1_m else F

// External measurement of `box1`
let m1 = box1_m

// External measurement of `box2`
let m2: Bool = measure(box2)

// Result: `m1` and `m2` do not necessarily agree (breaking the reality described by quantum theory)
print r
print (box1, box2)
print (m1, m2)
